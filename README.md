# annoying-program

Please, do not execute this code with your speakers on or at full volume.

Other than that, have fun running an innocent... malware? (can this program be considered as that)

# Oh, I'm scared

Dw, this program only creates a dialog box that will clone itself after some time and
emits a beep during the lifespan of the program, nothing that the task manager can't solve.

(the code is horrible, ik) oh, and the program is __Windows only__ btw.
